Perseverant, intelligent, and a problem solver. I would use these three words to describe myself and to say why I believe Carnegie Mellon University is the school where I would find the most success. Carnegie Mellon has a rigorous academic environment and will allow me to reap the rewards of an education fostered on determination and hard work. My passion for learning and gaining knowledge has always shone throughout my life, and I hope to live and study in a place where my values are held in the highest esteem. The interdisciplinary approach of Carnegie Mellon suits me, as I would apply knowledge from political science, computer science, psychology, and economic classes to my primary focus on Decision Science. Carnegie Mellon would allow me to formulate a curriculum where I take classes that are of interest and importance to me so that I can sculpt my ideal education. I will continue my tenacious approach to learning during college and I would love to do so at a school dedicated to “academics, academics, academics.”


My passions for politics and economics are both satisfied with a major in Decision Science. As a Decision Science major, I will be able to grasp the full extent of problems, and how people react differently to certain situations. By discovering why people make rational or irrational choices for legal, economic, and political decisions, I can predict outcomes and use this knowledge to the advantage of improving my community. Carnegie Mellon University’s Washington Semester Program is one of the many added benefits to studying at Carnegie Mellon. Getting the opportunity to study political policy and to intern in Washington D.C. is a once in a lifetime chance to turn my love for politics and economics into a concrete reality. Learning through experience in Washington D.C. with a prior knowledge from upper echelon classes at Carnegie Mellon will open doors not available to any other students.


With the exceptional education that I receive from Carnegie Mellon I will be able to take full advantage of the interesting and diverse jobs and internships in the city of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. Pittsburg has 8 Fortune 500 Companies and is a blossoming, booming city. There is a plethora of opportunities to find internships and success in the city and I will take full advantage of every open door in my path. I would love to have all of the choices that are given to Carnegie Mellon students to further my academic and personal pursuits. “My heart is in the work” and I will not squander any opportunities given to me. Not only does Pittsburg provide a variety of opportunities to flourish, but the campus itself is littered with student activities and clubs. My participation in Model UN during high school showed me various vantage points from countries around the world and I would love to continue discovering the interconnectedness and impacts of globalization while at Carnegie Mellon.


The diversity of not just ethnicities, but of the academic makeup of the student body, attracts me to Carnegie Mellon. In a globalizing and developing world, it is imperative to know something about everything and the ability to take classes between colleges and schools at Carnegie Mellon will allow me to better accomplish this. As a future CEO, learning from different students and from different classes across campus can help me foster a better sense of global problems and how to solve them. Within diversity there is a strong sense of unity. Diversity is the catalyst for success and I will take full advantage of the cornucopia of people and ideas throughout Carnegie Mellon to create the best solutions to various problems.
