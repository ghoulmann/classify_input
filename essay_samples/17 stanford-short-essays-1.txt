Surfing in the Fog


It is my belief that paddling out into the lineup through a bank of heavy mist and suddenly finding yourself unable to see the shore is among the most surreal and inspiring experiences a person can have. As fellow wave riders – strangers and friends – wink out of your sphere of sight and consciousness, as the steadfast constructs of society become transient and melt into the muffling grayness, all standards for comparison and preconceptions of perspective vanish and your thoughts branch out unfettered. As you ride (or duck beneath) the waves that silently appear before you, concepts that have long eluded you suddenly coalesce. The parallel pathfinding algorithm underlying my project for the Intel STS came to me not in a laboratory or classroom but as I watched the branching rivulets of water find their way down my surfboard as I emerged from underneath a wave (I saw how signals splitting and rejoining as they propagate through a network could simulate the shortest path problem in computer science). Often, I find it more productive to open my mind to the vast ocean's meditative lull than to study…


The adventurous aesthetic of nature is my source of intellectual vitality. Sitting at peace in the stillness between the hollow waves, inhaling the green-diffracted God-thought-breath of the morning forest, laughing as I hold wide my windbreaker and lean euphorically into the rushing torrents of the rain: this timeless rapture is my inspiration, this intricate, organic splendor a sanctified model for my thoughts. This is why I paddle out, never knowing exactly where I'll return to shore.


I'm a marked man...

I like ideas. I keep a list of "Good Ideas" myself: useful algorithms, designs for mechanisms, business strategies, general observations. It generated my '09 science fair project and the modular PHP framework I use in my web business; even many of my Internet ventures, such as tpclubs.com, were once just notes in this compendium. It's now over 1800 entries long, and has transcended the label "list":


I've semantically annotated the file and marked connections between concepts. This organization facilitates lookup (I group synonyms and potential keywords) and directs my brain to novel associations. Now, as I peruse my notes and am prompted to new invention, I almost feel as if I am merely transcribing connections made by an independent consciousness that has miraculously arisen in my text-only Google Document.


So why is this relevant to my interest in Stanford?


If my simple list of only 1800 linked concepts can show hints of consciousness in isolation, I want to see what will happen when I expose it to Stanford's open, multidisciplinary atmosphere. The school's combined excellence in technology, philosophy, and business has produced some of the greatest scientific advances of the modern age: witness SRI, SAIL, and Silicon Valley. I cannot resist wanting to join this world of interconnection, innovation, and implementation. Stanford EE/CS is my goal.


Moreover, the very nature of the ideas Stanford produces resonates with my own thinking. For example, it was Douglas Hofstadter's discourse on how sentience arises from self-referential systems that inspired me to point the ideas in my list to one another, forming complete loops of thought. Combine this with Stanford's relaxed social climate and the match is perfect. Attending looks to be a good idea indeed.
