Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate -- and us -- know you better. (100 to 250 words)


Good morning friend,


I tend to greet others with a “good morning” simply because I love mornings. This is ironic though, because I also have a great desire to stay up and really venture into the late night. Late night, when one resides in barren quiet and introspective analysis, is often my favorite time to work simply because it is distraction-free, and my exhaust allows my creativity to flourish. I don’t stay up late when I study for grades, but I do stay up for my own personal research in obscure topics ranging from Paul Gauguin’s personal life to budget functions applied mathematically. I won’t keep you up. I promise.


I hope you can accept the objects I bring. I have a bookcase that I like to live with because I aspire to have a large library of my own. I might buy a mini stove to make pancakes and eggs for dinner because breakfast foods are my favorite foods. I may actually put a mini kitchen above the bookcase, with a blender too, because my craving for milkshakes is excruciatingly insatiable. Don’t worry, I’ll give you some too.


But do know that I want to know you. I genuinely am curious as to what opinions you have over my interests, and hopefully you aren’t fond of sports. But if you are, that’s okay. I can tolerate who you are as long as you can accept who I am, and we can become great roommates.
