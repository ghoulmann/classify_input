Describe the world you come from – for example, your family, community or school – and tell us how your world has shaped your dreams and aspirations.


Most
children acquire the same eye color or a similar shaped nose from their parents,
but I’ve inherited much more: a passion for learning and an insatiable curiosity
which has served me well throughout my academic career. My father, an
electrical engineer, taught me to explore the world with inquisitive eyes,
constantly seeking to learn more, to understand more. I watched him for hours
as he worked on elevator schematics at home, wondering what all the various
symbols and lines meant. I was fascinated by technology and wanted to know how
and why things worked the way they did.


“How
does this toaster work?” “What’s inside this VCR?” I was never satisfied with the
simplified answers that my parents gave to these questions. So I discovered many
answers for myself by exploring and experimenting.


My
playground was a jumble of old circuit boards, spare electric wire, and an
assortment of broken appliances. I spent hours disassembling and tinkering with
the amazing treasures I found lying around our garage. My mother, a first grade
teacher, noticed my intellectual curiosity and encouraged my childhood
explorations. She gave me piles of mind-opening children’s books, which I
willingly read. Books like “What Makes Popcorn Pop, and Other Questions
about the World around Us” allowed me to discover the irresistible appeal of
imaginative questions and their fascinating answers.


I
was given a remarkable amount of freedom at a young age. When I was 8, my
parents bought an old computer for $25 from a local yard sale with the
intention of letting me loose on it. I was thrilled. Motivated by curiosity, I
delved into it at once and learned how to use each and every feature of the
computer’s antiquated MS-DOS operating system. With my father’s help and an old
programming book by my side, I even created simple videogames for my younger
brother to play.


My
parents taught me to be independent and self-motivated by providing me
opportunities to learn by trial and error. I recall an episode where my parents
bought a new microwave when I was just 10 years old. As they unpacked the
microwave, I caught sight of the owner’s manual and asked to see it. After reading
the 40-page text front-to-back, I learned one very important thing: how to use
a feature called “child lock,” or as I saw it, “parent lock.” By pressing a
special sequence of buttons on the microwave, I disabled it, thus protecting my
parents from the dangers of using the appliance without my supervision. Until
this day, the first thing I do after buying a new gadget is read the entire
manual, in search of nifty features.


My
intellectual curiosity is the result of a unique combination of early
influences and childhood experiences which have fueled my passion for learning
inside and outside of the classroom -- learning from everything I do. I hope to
continue applying this curiosity to all aspects of my life, exploring the world
through the eyes of my childhood persona. By refusing to accept the obvious
explanation, refusing to settle for a superficial understanding, and refusing
to endure the status quo, great American innovators like my role model Benjamin
Franklin created new knowledge, new technologies, and new innovations. I strive
to do the same. It’s part of who I am, and what drives me to become successful
and happy.
